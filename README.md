# Conduct-Me
At the moment, this project is completely nowhere near being finished - this is simply the hackathon build. I am currently in the process of rewriting the algorithm that determines when to proceed to the next note - ideally, I would like to use machine learning to process and adjust these points so that conducting feels more natural.

After I finish that, and clean up, debug/redesign the user interface, and clean up my code, I will launch an official build. 

Within the next few months, I plan on adding VR support for the Oculus Rift, either in Java, or more likely, by porting over to Unity and developing it on their platform.
